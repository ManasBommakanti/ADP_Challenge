# ADP Challenge
ADP Challenge App Submission

Our group created an interactive app that allows users to easily tabulate their hours and send hours to advisors. It utilizes several Android built-in resources as 
well as various APIs to make sure that the user can interact with the app. It also enhances the concept of gamification which encourages people to volunteer more 
often. 

On the backend spectrum, our app uses Firebase in order to secure Personal Identifiable Information (PII), such as passwords and telephone numbers. We also included 
algorithms to calculate several aspects of our app, such as the number of hours the user volunteered.
